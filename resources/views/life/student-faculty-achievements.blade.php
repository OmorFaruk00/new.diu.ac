                                <p class="mt-3">Actors are not born, they are made. This saying is quite true about
                                    17yrs Rakesh Jagarlamudi (born on June 17th, 2005), whose father is Vijay
                                    Jagarlamudi, and who is a producer in the Tollywood film industry. They are a
                                    five-member family, including his mother and two brothers. His native is
                                    Karamchedu Village in the Prakasam District of Andhra Pradesh. He has been
                                    living in Hyderabad since his childhood. He is presently pursuing a first-year
                                    BBA course from KLH GBS, Kondapur, Hyderabad campus.</p>
                                <p>His Debut Film as a Lead Actor is a PAN India Biopic of “Khudiram Bose.
                                    “&nbsp;His entry into the film industry started when his father was
                                    searching for a good story to produce, and he came across the Story of Khudiram
                                    Bose, one of the youngest freedom fighters and martyrs in the Indian freedom
                                    struggle. It all started with one thought&nbsp;why not Rakesh Play the
                                    character of Khudiram Bose?&nbsp;as&nbsp;he looked
                                    remarkably like Khudiram Bose.</p>
                                <p>In the beginning, he was much tensed because he never thought about
                                    getting into the field of acting even though he liked watching movies. But when
                                    his father approached him about the role, he couldn’t say no because he wanted
                                    to play that character when he heard about his story. So since then, he started
                                    working on himself, started improving his acting skills, fighting skills,
                                    dancing skills, and emotional skills.</p>
                                <p>It was very tough for him at first because he had limited time and was
                                    restlessly working throughout the day for three months. But his passion for
                                    cinema made him work beyond his limitations. He worked on strengthening himself
                                    and became flexible to get into the skin of the character.</p>
                                <p>When he decided to pursue acting as his career, he strongly felt to be
                                    a part of a good film, and Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav boosted his morale. He
                                    underwent a film acting course at the Mayukha film school in Hyderabad.</p>
                                <p>But then the real struggle started when he started working on the
                                    Individual Character of Khudiram Bose. He underwent rigorous training in
                                    different aspects. He had to emotionally, and mentally get connected to the
                                    character to fit into the shoes of a real freedom fighter. As it is a real-life
                                    character, he has to do his best to portray it realistically.</p>
                                <p>He along with his director worked on the character for two months
                                    straight before the shoot, and finally after which he became confident to play
                                    the character of Khudiram Bose. For this character, he had to lose weight
                                    two-three times, and he underwent a lot of struggle when they had to shoot in
                                    the forests of Maredumally. He had to run with his bare foot for a few scenes,
                                    which was necessary for the film. He underwent a lot of mental and physical
                                    struggle to coordinate with every department and act in front of hundreds of
                                    people. He learned many things in the process, and he hopes to continue in the
                                    Film Industry as an actor in the coming years.</p>
                                <p>In this journey, his family, his director, his cinematographer, other
                                    Technical Crew, and Co- actors supported him as it was his Debut Film. The main
                                    Credit goes to his father Vijay Jagarlamudi, who helped me get into the field
                                    and supported him throughout his future aspects.</p>
                                <p>As a part of achievements, the movie Khudiram Bose was screened in the
                                    Indian Panorama section of the 53rd International Film Festival of India in Goa
                                    along with movies like Akhanda, Cinema Bandi, Major, etc.… The Ministry of
                                    Information and Broadcasting has stated that the film was screened on December
                                    22nd, 2022, for the Parliamentarians (MPs) in Film Division Auditorium, Mahadev
                                    Road, New Delhi. After watching the film many MPs congratulated him. The film
                                    will be released in seven Indian languages.</p>
                                <p>His Message to society and the Quote that pushed him to work hard is -
                                    "Tough times create strong men, strong men create easy times. Easy times create
                                    weak men, weak men create tough times."</p>
